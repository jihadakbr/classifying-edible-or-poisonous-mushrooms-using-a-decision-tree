# Classifying edible or poisonous mushrooms using a decision tree

This project was completed as a part of the Honors portion of the [Advanced Learning Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms) Course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

## Objective

The objective of starting the company is to cultivate and sell wild mushrooms. However, since not all mushrooms are safe to consume, the primary aim is to develop a system that can distinguish between edible and poisonous mushrooms based on their physical attributes. Utilizing existing data, the goal is to use this information to identify which mushrooms can be sold securely and ensure the safety of the customers.
